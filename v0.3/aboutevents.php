                                <p class="justify">
                                    Another major part of AOAT is exposing our students to college, and making this an actual goal for them to prepare for throughout high school. College tours – and the workshops before and after – confirm for them the necessity of good grades and participation in high school activities. This past spring we took 10th graders to University of Southern California, and 11th graders on a double tour of both California State University Northridge and our closest community college, Pierce. Both grade levels researched the designated schools, and our AOAT counselor Ami McColl reviewed with them their current credits and what they need to do to be ready to apply to college their senior year.

                                <p class="justify">
                                    Several AOAT teachers belong to the MOCA program Contemporary Art Start that provides two trips to the museum every year. These trips take place in the fall and spring, and are often a reward for students with a grade average of C and above. Students learn about contemporary art, and have the opportunity to explore downtown Los Angeles.

                                <p class="justify">
                                    Various ECCO workshops throughout the year prepare students for college and career, and perhaps the most important are the Career Exploration series. In 2011-2012 we had amazing trips during the fall to two new locations – the 10th graders all visited DreamWorks, and the 11th graders toured UCLA Hammer Museum of Art. Being able to see and hear from the people behind the scenes at a leading film studio and an eclectic art collection really opened eyes to career possibilities unknown to our young people. They researched both sites before the visit and did activities that informed and piqued their curiosity about hidden jobs and transferrable skills.
