                                    Our devoted Board of Advisory members take leadership roles in designing and delivering authentic mock interviews as preparation for internships for our 11th graders. The spring event included three days of interviews by professionals who volunteered their time to talk with the students both individually and as a group debrief afterwards. Students prepared by practicing in peer groups, and expressed feeling much more confident to go on internship interviews after this exercise.

                                Since 2011, summer internships have provided life-changing experiences for students, preparing them with real world skills and confidence to take on life as adults after graduation. Many of our summer hosts repeat from year to year, which makes the process easier and proves that the benefits go both ways. Our Internship Teacher Team puts in long hours to make sure there are enough appropriate host sites to accommodate and mentor all our candidates for the six weeks of exploratory work experience.

                                During the 6-week internship, students attend a 2-hour seminar every week and work at their host site a minimum of 20 hours per week. AOAT teachers visit the interns at their jobs twice during the six weeks to insure that both student and host are benefiting from the experience. Interns prepare a culminating project beyond their regular work assignments and present it at a final celebration which brings together students and their families and the host businesses to recognize the successful completion of the summer internship.

The mentors and mentees meet during lunch once a week, and can either help with homework, tests, or personal issues that the younger students would like to talk about.

The theme of social justice, as reflected in literature and history, is the lens through which students examine the elements that contribute to how each individual can influence his community and the world. The interdisciplinary trip is a tour of the Museum of Tolerance.

                                    This year's curriculum is centered on the theme of Student Identity. Students create their own Identity Package which includes a personal logo, business stationery and business cards. In addition, students create a resumé and an All About Me brochure/website. In United States history and American literature, students focus on the individual's identity in American society, investigating and analyzing the life of an individual social activist in American history. The culminating interdisciplinary project is a comprehensive brochure or web site, based around a social activism event, which students present to lower grade level classes. This satisfies their service-learning requirement for graduation.

Literature, history and art classes coordinate efforts to present and encourage topics for exploration as well as the process that students will use to produce the requisite assignments. Students focus on their design area of concentration and are encouraged to take Advanced Placement courses as well as advanced art classes offered by the Art Department.
