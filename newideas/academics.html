							<p>
								Students in grades 10, 11 and 12 participate in workshops every year that prepare them for careers. These workshops include topics such as transferrable skills, the hidden jobs within each profession, writing and revising resumes, etc. Each year students visit different businesses in the focus area of our Academy, learning about how their classes are connected to the real world of work.
							</p>
							<h4>Mock Interviews</h4>
							<p>
								Our devoted Board of Advisory members take leadership roles in designing and delivering authentic mock interviews as preparation for internships for our 11th graders. The spring event included three days of interviews by professionals who volunteered their time to talk with the students both individually and as a group debrief afterwards. Students prepared by practicing in peer groups, and expressed feeling much more confident to go on internship interviews after this exercise.

						<div id="Internships" class="collapse in">
							<p>
								Since 2011, summer internships have provided life-changing experiences for students, preparing them with real world skills and confidence to take on life as adults after graduation. Many of our summer hosts repeat from year to year, which makes the process easier and proves that the benefits go both ways. Our Internship Teacher Team puts in long hours to make sure there are enough appropriate host sites to accommodate and mentor all our candidates for the six weeks of exploratory work experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								The process of preparing 11th graders for their summer internship includes: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Workshops and a class Career Exploration visit</li>
								<li>Designing a personal logo and business stationery</li>
								<li>Creating a formal resumé</li>
								<li>Job shadow in career field of their interest</li>
								<li>Career interest assessment and research</li>
								<li>Parent informational meeting</li>
								<li>Workshops connected to Career Day</li>
								<li>Mock interviews</li>
								<li>Application requiring GPA confirmation and parent approval</li>
								<li>Matching of intern candidates and host sites</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								During the 6-week internship, students attend a 2-hour seminar every week and work at their host site a minimum of 20 hours per week. AOAT teachers visit the interns at their jobs twice during the six weeks to insure that both student and host are benefiting from the experience. Interns prepare a culminating project beyond their regular work assignments and present it at a final celebration which brings together students and their families and the host businesses to recognize the successful completion of the summer internship.

								Each year the 11th and 12th grade students are invited to participate in our Peer Mentor program, and are matched with a 9th or 10th grader who has self-selected to receive this support. The mentors and mentees meet during lunch once a week, and can either help with homework, tests, or personal issues that the younger students would like to talk about.

								<h4>Grade 10: Theme: Awareness</h4>
								<h5>Team Leader: ?</h5>
								<p>
									The overall theme for 10th Grade is Social Group Awareness, and students explore what community means, how group identity is vital to change and how to create community. The theme of social justice, as reflected in literature and history, is the lens through which students examine the elements that contribute to how each individual can influence his community and the world. The interdisciplinary trip is a tour of the Museum of Tolerance.

								<h4>Grade 11: Theme: Identity</h4>
								<h5>Team Leader: Laura Neustaedter</h5>
								<p>
									This year's curriculum is centered on the theme of Student Identity. Students create their own Identity Package which includes a personal logo, business stationery and business cards. In addition, students create a resumé and an All About Me brochure/website. In United States history and American literature, students focus on the individual's identity in American society, investigating and analyzing the life of an individual social activist in American history. The culminating interdisciplinary project is a comprehensive brochure or web site, based around a social activism event, which students present to lower grade level classes. This satisfies their service-learning requirement for graduation.

								<h4>Grade 12: Theme: Activism</h4>
								<h5>Team Leader: Wesley DeGracia</h5>
								<p>
									The overall theme of the year is Social, Economic and Political Awareness. Students focus on a specific area in which they hope to effect change. They produce a research paper and brochure that explains and examines their understanding of and potential solutions for their issue. Literature, history and art classes coordinate efforts to present and encourage topics for exploration as well as the process that students will use to produce the requisite assignments. Students focus on their design area of concentration and are encouraged to take Advanced Placement courses as well as advanced art classes offered by the Art Department.
